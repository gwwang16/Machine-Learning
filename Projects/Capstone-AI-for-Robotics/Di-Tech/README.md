# Di-Tech Competition

## Background
As less than 10% of Chinaâ€™s 1.4 billion citizens own automobiles, the frequency at which Chinese citizens commute on taxis, buses, trains, and planes is the highest in the world. Didi Chuxing, the dominant ride-hailing company in China, processes over 11 million trips, plans over 9 billion routes and collects over 50TB of data per day. To meet needs of riders, Didi must continually innovate to improve cloud computing and big data technologies and algorithms in order to process this massive amount of data and uphold service reliability.
Supply-demand forecasting is critical to enabling Didi to maximise utilisation of drivers and ensure that riders can always get a car whenever and wherever they may need a ride. Supply-demand forecasting helps to predict the volume of drivers and riders at a certain time period in a specific geographic area. For instance, demand tends to surge in residential areas in the mornings and in business districts in the evenings. Supply-demand forecasting allows Didi to predict demand surges and guide drivers to those areas. The end result is higher earnings for drivers and no surge pricing for riders!
